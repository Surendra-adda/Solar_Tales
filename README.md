# Solar Tales
Solar Tales is an interactive, educational web application designed to teach users about space weather. Through an engaging, character-driven story, users explore concepts like solar flares, auroras, and the impact of solar events on Earth's technology and inhabitants.

The project combines an illustrated narrative, real NASA facts, and an interactive quiz to create a fun and accessible learning experience for all ages.

## ✨ Features

*   **Engaging Quiz:** A 10-question quiz to test knowledge gained from the story. Users can earn a "Star Gazer," "Aurora Explorer," or "Space Weather Master" badge based on their score.
*   **Dynamic UI & Animations:** A rich, space-themed interface with animated backgrounds, including a starfield and an aurora overlay, built with pure CSS and JavaScript.
