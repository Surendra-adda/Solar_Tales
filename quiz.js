    question: "What kind of 'special letter' does Sunny send?",
    options: [
        "Rain and thunderstorms",
        "Solar flares and CMEs",
        "Moonlight and starlight",
        "Clouds and lightning"
    ],
    correct: 1,
    explanation: "The Sun sends out solar flares and CMEs, which are bursts of energy and charged particles that can travel to Earth and affect satellites, power grids, and communications."
},
{
    question: "How fast does Flarey travel toward Earth?",
    options: [
        "Only near the Moon",
        "Faster than anything on Earth",
        "Only during daytime",
        "Slowly across space"
    ],
    correct: 1,
    explanation: "Coronal Mass Ejections (CMEs) can travel at speeds ranging from 250 km/s to 3,000 km/s, reaching Earth in hours to a few days."

{
    question: "What is the invisible shield Flarey sees around Earth?",
    options: [
        "Earth's magnetosphere",
        "A bubble of clouds",
        "A protective dome of glass",
        "A giant net of satellites"
    ],
    correct: 0,
    explanation: "Earth's magnetosphere is a region of space where the planet's magnetic field deflects most of the solar wind, protecting Earth from harmful radiation."

    question: "What beautiful effect does Nani see in the sky?",
    options: [
        "Lightning storms",
        "Auroras (green and purple lights)",
        "Sun halos",
        "Shooting stars"
    ],
    correct: 1,
    explanation: "Auroras occur when charged particles from the Sun collide with gases in Earth's atmosphere, producing colorful lights typically near the poles."

    question: "Why did Pilot Ravi hear a GPS warning on the radio?",
    options: [
        "His radio was broken",
        "Sunny’s letter disrupted signals",
        "The Sun was too bright",
        "There was heavy rain"
    ],
    correct: 1,
    explanation: "Solar storms can interfere with GPS and radio communications, particularly at high latitudes, affecting pilots and other users."
},
{
    question: "Why did Farmer Lila’s drones lose signal?",
    options: [
        "Space weather interfered with technology",
        "Birds blocked them",
        "The drones ran out of battery",
        "It was nighttime"
    ],
    correct: 0,
    explanation: "Solar activity can disrupt GPS signals and other electronics, which can impact agriculture technologies like drones."
},
{
    question: "Why did Astronaut Maya go to the shielded room on the ISS?",
    options: [
        "To sleep",
        "To watch movies",
        "To stay safe from solar storm particles",
        "To exercise"
    ],
    correct: 2,
    explanation: "Astronauts use shielded areas on the ISS to protect themselves from high-energy particles during solar storms."
},
{
    question: "What did Omar the Power Operator notice?",
    options: [
        "Streets flooding",
        "Electricity flickers due to Flarey",
        "Satellites falling from the sky",
        "Auroras changing color"
    ],
    correct: 1,
    explanation: "Strong solar storms can induce currents in power grids, causing voltage fluctuations, flickers, or blackouts."
},
{
